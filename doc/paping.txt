NAME
       paping - Cross-platform TCP port testing, emulating the functionality of ping (port ping)

SYNOPSIS
       paping [options] destination

DESCRIPTION
       The papping command is used to communicate with another host using the TCP protocol (SYN,ACK and FYN).
       Paping uses a 3-way handshake and finished connection to test communicate with another host,
       similiar "Ping", but using only TCP connection.

       1) Caller sends SYN
       2) Recipient responds with SYN, ACK
       3) Caller sends ACK
       4) Caller sends ACK, FYN
       5) Recipient responds FYN, ACK

       Paping works only IPv4 and TCP.
